# Ammo percentage overlay

Ammo percentage overlay displays the equipped weapon's ammo as a percentage on the screen.
This is useful for making sure you are efficiently using your ammo, ideally reaching that 50% mark on everything before taking a resupply cassette.

---------------------------------

Known issues:

 - Sentry gun ammo percentage is inaccurate

Roadmap:

 - Display grenade amount as percentage
 - Display nitra amount as amount of supplies and the amount needed for next one
 - Display driller C4 amount as percentage
 - Display driller drill fuel amount as percentage
 - Make the UI look nicer (Currently just white text at a static location, ew)
