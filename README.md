# Ammo percentage overlay

Ammo percentage overlay displays the currently equipped weapon's ammo as a percentage on the screen.
This is useful for making sure you are efficiently using your ammo, ideally reaching that 50% mark on everything before taking a resupply cassette.

---------------------------------

Known issues:

 - Sentry gun ammo percentage is ~~inaccurate~~ ~~un-intuitive~~ NEEDS FIXING
 - Sometimes the overlay won't load (should be fixed)
